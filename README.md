I am not only a photographer, but also a brand designer and front-end developer. I love to work on projects that have a strong visual identity and I believe that the best way to communicate with people is through imagery.

Skills: HTML | CSS | JS | Adobe XD | Adobe Illustrator | Adobe Lightroom | Adobe Photoshop | Adobe Premiere Pro | Adobe After Effects | Adobe Dimension.

My Design Philosophy:

- 📏 "The life of a designer is a life of fight against the ugliness"

My Philosophy:

- 🧑‍💻 Aristotle:
"Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."

- 🧑‍💻 William Shakespeare - Sonnet 116:
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove."

- 🧑‍💻 Dr. Gregory House:
"Doing things changes things. Not doing things leaves things exactly as they were."

- 🧑‍💻 Stephen Fry:
"A true thing, poorly expressed, is a lie."
