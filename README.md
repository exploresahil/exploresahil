I am not only a photographer, but also a brand designer and front-end developer. I love to work on projects that have a strong visual identity and I believe that the best way to communicate with people is through imagery.

My Design Philosophy:

- 📏 "The life of a designer is a life of fight against the ugliness"

- 📏 "A logo is not a brand, A brand is not an identity, A brand is not a product. A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service or organization. It exists in the hearts and minds of individuals."

- 📏 "In design, be logical, search for the truth, be clear."

My Philosophy:

- 🧑‍💻 Stephen Fry:
"A true thing, poorly expressed, is a lie."

- 🧑‍💻 Aristotle:
"Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."

- 🧑‍💻 William Shakespeare - Sonnet 116:
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove."

- 🧑‍💻 Dr. Gregory House:
"Doing things changes things. Not doing things leaves things exactly as they were."
